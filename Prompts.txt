--- COPILOT INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUTUBE WORKSPACE (DOE) ---

Architecture Overview - 3-Layer Architecture:

Layer 1: Directives (What to do)
- Location: directives/
- SOPs written in Markdown that define goals, inputs, execution steps, outputs, and error handling
- Natural language instructions for workflows

Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision Making)
- Read directives, decide which tools to call, handle errors, ask for clarification
- Route between intent and execution
- When a directive requires a tool, find the corresponding script in execution/ and call it

Layer 3: Execution (Doing the Work)
- Location: execution/
- Deterministic Python scripts for API calls, data processing, file operations
- All scripts accept CLI arguments and handle their own error reporting

Key Principles:
1. Check for Tools First - Before writing new code, check execution/ for existing scripts
2. Self-Anneal When Things Break - Read errors, fix scripts, update directives with learnings
3. Update Directives as You Learn - Directives are living documents

--- AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ---

Operating Principles:
1. Check for tools first - Before writing a script, check execution/ per directive
2. Self-anneal when things break - Fix script, test, update directive
3. Update directives as you learn - Directives are your instruction set

Self-annealing loop:
1. Fix the error
2. Update the tool
3. Test tool, make sure it works
4. Update directive to include new flow
5. System is now stronger

File Organization:
- .tmp/ - All intermediate files (never commit, always regenerated)
- execution/ - Python scripts (deterministic tools)
- directives/ - SOPs in Markdown (instruction set)
- .env - Environment variables and API keys
- credentials.json, token.json - Google OAuth credentials

Key principle: Local files are only for processing. Deliverables live in cloud services.

analyze current workspace for poll service
currently it is configured to ShYlpa ,revert to RCB 2.0 
scheduler shoud run at 6PM all week days except friday
there is RCB 2.0 poll service
Create a Google Cloud Function
2. Create a Google Cloud Function
Create a Cloud Function that will handle sending polls.  Here's the basic flow:
Function Purpose:

Trigger at scheduled times (via Cloud Scheduler)
Fetch poll data from Firestore/database
Send interactive poll messages via Green API


3. Set Up Google Cloud Scheduler
Configure a scheduler job to trigger your function:

Go to Cloud Scheduler in Google Cloud Console
Create a new job with your desired schedule (cron syntax)
Set the HTTP target to your Cloud Function URL
