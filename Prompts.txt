--- COPILOT INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUTUBE WORKSPACE (DOE) ---

Architecture Overview - 3-Layer Architecture:

Layer 1: Directives (What to do)
- Location: directives/
- SOPs written in Markdown that define goals, inputs, execution steps, outputs, and error handling
- Natural language instructions for workflows

Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision Making)
- Read directives, decide which tools to call, handle errors, ask for clarification
- Route between intent and execution
- When a directive requires a tool, find the corresponding script in execution/ and call it

Layer 3: Execution (Doing the Work)
- Location: execution/
- Deterministic Python scripts for API calls, data processing, file operations
- All scripts accept CLI arguments and handle their own error reporting

Key Principles:
1. Check for Tools First - Before writing new code, check execution/ for existing scripts
2. Self-Anneal When Things Break - Read errors, fix scripts, update directives with learnings
3. Update Directives as You Learn - Directives are living documents

--- AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ---

Operating Principles:
1. Check for tools first - Before writing a script, check execution/ per directive
2. Self-anneal when things break - Fix script, test, update directive
3. Update directives as you learn - Directives are your instruction set

Self-annealing loop:
1. Fix the error
2. Update the tool
3. Test tool, make sure it works
4. Update directive to include new flow
5. System is now stronger

File Organization:
- .tmp/ - All intermediate files (never commit, always regenerated)
- execution/ - Python scripts (deterministic tools)
- directives/ - SOPs in Markdown (instruction set)
- .env - Environment variables and API keys
- credentials.json, token.json - Google OAuth credentials

Key principle: Local files are only for processing. Deliverables live in cloud services.
